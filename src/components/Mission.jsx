            <div className="row">
                <p>We strive to bring people interesting and unique art that inspires them to be more creative and enjoy
                    their homes. We know art can be expensive, so we work with a rotating set of artists and
                    photographers
                    to bring you fantastic prints - all for free. We just ask that you donate what you think is fair, or
                    share the site with someone who might like great art as much as you do. </p>
